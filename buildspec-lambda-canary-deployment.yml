# buildspec-lambda-canary-deployment.yml
# This buildspec represents a placeholder for CodeDeploy's Lambda deployment hooks
# when performing a canary rollout. CodeDeploy manages traffic shifting.
# In this file, we assume CodeDeploy is handling the actual traffic shift based on
# its deployment group configuration.
# This specific buildspec is for demonstrating custom actions or post-traffic shift validation.
version: 0.2

# CodeDeploy's Lambda deployments don't typically run a buildspec.yml directly
# instead, CodeDeploy uses its own mechanism for traffic shifting and optional Lambda hooks.
# This buildspec exists as a conceptual placeholder if you were to have a CodeBuild
# action in CodePipeline that *manually* triggers a CodeDeploy Lambda deployment
# or performs post-deployment actions.

# However, for AWS CodePipeline's direct integration with AWS CodeDeploy for Lambda,
# you use the 'AWS CodeDeploy' action type with 'DeploymentStyle: Lambda' in CodePipeline.
# This action type handles the traffic shifting directly, and doesn't explicitly
# execute a buildspec.yml for the traffic shift itself.

# This buildspec is primarily for a scenario where you might want to perform
# custom pre-traffic hook validation or post-traffic hook validation.

# Example: If you had a custom CodeBuild action for Post-Traffic Hook Validation
# phases:
#   install:
#     commands:
#       - echo "Setting up environment for validation..."
#       - sudo apt-get update -y
#       - sudo apt-get install -y curl jq
#
#   build:
#     commands:
#       - echo "Retrieving Lambda alias info for validation..."
#       # You would typically pass the current version, target version, alias names
#       # as environment variables to this CodeBuild project via CodePipeline.
#       - CURRENT_LIVE_VERSION=$(aws lambda get-alias --function-name TransactionSimulatorAPI --name LIVE | jq -r '.FunctionVersion')
#       - echo "Current LIVE alias version: $CURRENT_LIVE_VERSION"
#       - # Perform actual validation against the new version or blended traffic
#       - API_URL=$(jq -r '.api_gateway_invoke_url.value' terraform_outputs.json) # Assuming terraform_outputs.json is available
#       - echo "Running health check on API: $API_URL"
#       - curl -sS -f "$API_URL/api/login" # Example health check
#       - echo "Validation successful."
#
#   post_build:
#     commands:
#       - echo "Custom post-traffic hook validation complete."
#

#   files: [] # No specific artifacts needed from this stage

# For now, this will be an empty buildspec as the primary canary deployment is handled by CodeDeploy's Lambda action itself.
# We will ensure the CodePipeline definition uses the direct CodeDeploy Lambda action type.
# This file still needs to exist to be referenced by a CodeBuild project in CodePipeline.
